Resolving issue of sparse rewards:
	(Medium - https://medium.com/@m.k.daaboul/dealing-with-sparse-reward-environments-38c0489c844d)
	1. Use Curriculum learning to solve the sparse reward issue in AR use case. (https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2020/01/29/curriculum-for-reinforcement-learning.html ----> good source)
	2. Tweak reward function to give mid-level rewards
	3. Can use GoalGAN to generate easier goals
	4. Auxiliary tasks (mid-level tasks)
